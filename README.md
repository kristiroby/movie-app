# movie-app
Used html, css, jQuery, AJAX and the movieDB APi.
The API wasn't able to pull the type of information I originally planned, so I had to pivot a bit. I started by making sure I understood what I could call and how to access specific information. Then I made the drop down menus and search bar for the year. I had to figure out how to use the information the user selected to alter the API call.
