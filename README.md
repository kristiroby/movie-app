# movie-app
Used html, css, jQuery, AJAX and the movieDB APi.
The API wasn't able to pull the type of information I originally planned, so I had to pivot a bit. I started by making sure I understood what I could call and how to access specific information. Then I made the drop down menus and search bar for the year. I had to figure out how to use the information the user selected to alter the API call. The next challenges I faced were getting the elements to respond when the user hovered over them, which was tricky because they were part of the same unordered list. I ended up using a combination of italicizing text and changing the background color. Then I had to work on the modals. Getting each summary to display was easier than I expected, but formatting the box and button was a challenge.
